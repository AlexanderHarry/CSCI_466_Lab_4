2.
    a)   
        1. The 48-bit ethernet address of my computer is 34:13:e8:25:f4:13

	2. The destination address is 18:31:bf:68:e5:20.  This is not the ethernet address of gaia.cs.umass.edu.  This device is my router.

	3.   The hexadecimal value for the frame type is 0x0800.  This corresponds to the upper layer protocol IP.
	
       4. it occurs 55 bytes from the very start of the ethernet frame.


	b) An ARP query is sent within a broadcast frame because the querying host doesn’t know the mac address for the IP.  The ARP response is sent within a frame with a specific destination MAC address because the node responding to an ARP query knows the MAC source address of the query.

	c)
	
	12. 
       a) The opcode field begins at the 21st byte.
       b) The value of opcode is request (1)
		c) Yes, the ARP message does contain the IP address of the sender.
		d) It appears in the target IP address of ARP.
	13.
		a) The ARP opcode begins at the 21st byte.
		b) The value of the opcode field is reply (2)
		c) The ARP message requests appears in the Sender IP address field.

	14. The hexadecimal value for the source is 34:13:e8:25:f4:13.  The value for the destination is 18:31:bf:68:e5:20.

	15. There is no response because of the fact that we are not the correct source address in which the broadcast is referring to.

	d) The default amount of time that an entry remains in my ARP cache is 60 seconds.  I used the code "cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/neigh/default/gc_stale_time" (source: https://askubuntu.com/questions/516567/how-long-is-an-arp-entry-cached-for) in my terminal.
